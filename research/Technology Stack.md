# üöÄ Technology Stack Recommendation for ‚ÄúBuild to Learn‚Äù

Choosing the right tech stack is vital for building a scalable, performant, and developer-friendly learning platform. Considering your team‚Äôs expertise in React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Next.js, this stack is tailored to maximize familiarity while following modern best practices.

## 1. üñ• Frontend: **Next.js (with React)**

- **Why:** Next.js is perfect for a content-driven platform like this. It supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) ‚Äì great for SEO, performance, and caching.
- **Perks:**

  - Built-in routing
  - Image optimization
  - API routes
  - Seamless integration with Vercel for deployment

## 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Options

### **Option A: Next.js API Routes**

- Keep backend logic co-located with frontend in a monorepo.
- Suitable for handling: user auth, course progression, discussions, blogs, certificates, etc.

### **Option B: Express.js Server**

- Use when the backend logic becomes complex or needs independent scaling (e.g., mobile app APIs).
- Best for clear separation of concerns and microservice architecture.

> üîß **Recommendation:** Start with **Next.js API Routes** and migrate to a standalone Express server if needed later.

## 3. üß© Database: **MongoDB + Mongoose**

- Flexible document structure fits your course, user, and forum data well.
- Mongoose provides schema validation, virtuals, population, and powerful querying.

## 4. üîê Authentication: **NextAuth.js**

- Easy integration with Next.js.
- Supports:

  - Email/password (Credentials)
  - OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
  - Session-based or JWT authentication

- Scalable and production-ready.

## 5. üé® Styling & UI

- **Tailwind CSS:** Fast, utility-first styling with great flexibility.
- **Component Libraries (Optional):** Use **ShadCN**, **Chakra UI**, or **Material UI** for pre-built, accessible components.
- **Animation:** Integrate **Framer Motion** for smooth UI transitions.

## 6. üìö Content Display

- **Markdown Rendering:**

  - Use `react-markdown` or `marked` for parsing.
  - Sanitize with `DOMPurify` to prevent XSS attacks.

- **Rich Text Editors:**

  - For blog/forum input: use **Tiptap** (ProseMirror-based), **Editor.js**, or **Quill.js** for intuitive writing experiences.

## 7. üé• Media Handling

- **Video Embeds:** Use YouTube `<iframe>` or build a custom player with embedded video links.
- **File Storage (Projects, Attachments):**

  - **Cloudinary**: Optimized for images/videos, comes with a CDN and transformation tools.
  - **AWS S3**: Reliable and scalable for large file uploads.

## 8. üìÑ PDF Generation (Certificates)

- **pdf-lib**: Lightweight client/server-side PDF generation.
- **Puppeteer**: Use for complex PDF layouts (server-side only).

### 9. üïµÔ∏è MCQ Cheat Detection

- **Tab Switching Detection:**

  - Use the `visibilitychange` event to track when users leave the quiz window.

- **Clipboard/Paste Events:**

  - Basic detection with `onpaste`, but limit its use due to UX/privacy concerns.

- **Timing & Attempts:**

  - Track time per question and total attempts for better analysis.

### 10. üì¶ DevOps

#### **Docker:**

- Containerize your app for consistent development and deployment.

#### **CI/CD: GitHub Actions**

- Automate testing, builds, and deployment pipelines.
- Can easily integrate with Vercel or other deployment platforms.

### 11. ‚úÖ Testing

| Type            | Tool                  |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| **Unit Tests**  | Jest                  |
| **Component**   | React Testing Library |
| **API Testing** | Supertest (w/ Jest)   |
| **E2E Tests**   | Cypress / Playwright  |

### 12. üöÄ Deployment

| Platform         | Use Case                                                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vercel**       | Ideal for Next.js, auto-deployment from GitHub, fast & simple. |
| **Netlify**      | Alternative to Vercel with similar features.                   |
| **AWS / GCP**    | For custom infrastructure, scaling, and advanced control.      |
| **DigitalOcean** | Good middle ground for price vs. control.                      |

### üîÅ Future-Proofing

- **Microservices Readiness:** Structure the project for easy separation into services later.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement roles (student, instructor, admin) early.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Use tools like LogRocket or Sentry for frontend error tracking.
