## Slide 3: Background

### Content:
```
Background

Why This Field is Important:

• Online learning has grown exponentially, with the global e-learning 
  market projected to reach $325 billion by 2025

• Traditional education systems struggle to provide practical, hands-on 
  experience in technical fields

• The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift to online education, 
  creating urgent demand for effective digital learning platforms

Current Industry Relevance:

• 73% of students report using multiple platforms for a single course, 
  leading to fragmented learning experiences

• Employers increasingly value practical project experience over 
  theoretical knowledge and certificates
```

### Script (1 minute):
"Let me provide some context on why this field is critically important. The online learning industry is experiencing explosive growth, with the global e-learning market expected to reach $325 billion by 2025. The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically accelerated this shift, forcing millions of students worldwide to adapt to digital learning.

However, current research shows that 73% of students juggle multiple platforms for a single course, creating a fragmented and confusing experience. More importantly, employers today value practical project experience far more than certificates alone. This creates a gap between what students learn online and what the job market actually demands."

## Slide 4: Problem Statement

### Content:
```
Problem Statement

Critical Issues in Current Online Learning:

1. Why do students spend hours watching tutorials but struggle to 
   implement concepts independently? (Tutorial Hell)

2. How can passive video-based learning be transformed into active, 
   hands-on practice?

3. What causes the lack of motivation and high dropout rates (60%) 
   in online courses?

4. Why do existing LMS platforms fail to provide real-world project 
   experience that employers value?

5. How can we ensure academic integrity in online assessments 
   without proper anti-cheat mechanisms?

Existing systems focus on content delivery rather than skill development, 
leaving students unprepared for real-world challenges.
```

### Script (1.5 minutes):
"Our research identified five critical problems in current online learning systems. First and foremost is the phenomenon we call 'Tutorial Hell' - students spend countless hours watching coding tutorials, feeling like they're learning, but when they try to code independently, they struggle. This is because most platforms focus on passive video consumption rather than active practice.

Second, how do we transform passive learning into hands-on experience? Current LMS platforms are heavily video-focused, but watching alone doesn't build skills.

Third, what causes the alarming 60% dropout rate in online courses? Students lose motivation when learning feels slow, boring, or unsupported.

Fourth, why don't existing platforms provide real-world project experience? Most focus on quizzes and certificates, but employers want to see actual projects and portfolios.

Finally, how do we maintain academic integrity? Many platforms lack proper anti-cheat mechanisms, undermining the credibility of online education. These problems create a significant gap between online learning and real-world readiness."

## Slide 5: Motivation

### Content:
```
Motivation

Why We Chose This Topic:

Personal Experience:
• As final-year CSE students, we experienced "Tutorial Hell" firsthand
• We spent years watching tutorials without building real projects
• We often thought: "If we had known this earlier, our career path 
  could have been different"

Academic Journey Insights:
• Lack of proper guidelines and practical direction during our studies
• Limited real-world exposure in traditional coursework
• Difficulty bridging the gap between theory and practice

What Inspired This Project:
• Desire to help future students avoid the same struggles
• Passion for making technical education more accessible and practical
• Vision to create the learning platform we wish we had
```

### Script (1.5 minutes):
"Our motivation for this project is deeply personal. As final-year Computer Science students, we've experienced 'Tutorial Hell' firsthand. We spent years watching countless programming tutorials, feeling productive, but when it came time to build actual projects, we struggled.

Throughout our four-year academic journey, we faced many challenges - lack of proper guidelines, limited practical direction, and minimal real-world exposure. We often reflected: if we had known certain things earlier, if we had focused on building projects instead of just watching tutorials, our career preparation could have been significantly better.

This project was inspired by a simple question: What if we could create the learning platform we wish we had when we started? A platform that forces you to build, not just watch. A platform that provides clear project-based goals instead of endless video lectures. A platform that prepares you for actual job requirements, not just exams.

We wanted to solve this problem not just for ourselves, but for every student who will come after us. That's what drives this project - the desire to make technical education more practical, accessible, and career-focused."

## Slide 6: Objectives

### Content:
```
Objectives

Main Objective:
To develop a web-based learning platform where students acquire skills 
through active project construction rather than passive content consumption

Specific Objectives:

1. To design a project-first learning system where every course module 
   focuses on hands-on project work

2. To implement gamification features (points, leaderboards) that 
   motivate students and encourage healthy competition

3. To develop an intuitive user interface that minimizes complexity 
   and maximizes learning time

4. To integrate anti-cheat mechanisms for maintaining academic 
   integrity in online assessments

5. To evaluate the platform's effectiveness through comprehensive 
   testing and user feedback analysis
```

### Script (1.5 minutes):
"Our main objective was clear: develop a web-based learning platform where students acquire skills through active project construction, not passive video watching.

To achieve this, we defined five specific objectives. First, to design a project-first learning system. Unlike traditional platforms where projects are optional extras, in our system, every course module centers around a hands-on project. Students can't just watch and move on - they must build.

Second, to implement gamification features. We integrated points and leaderboards to make learning more engaging and create healthy competition among students.

Third, to develop an intuitive user interface. We wanted students spending time learning, not struggling with complicated navigation. Our UI is clean, simple, and distraction-free.

Fourth, to integrate anti-cheat mechanisms. We implemented behavioral detection for tab switching and copy-paste attempts during quizzes, maintaining the credibility of online assessments.

Finally, to evaluate our platform's effectiveness through comprehensive testing. We conducted performance testing, security testing, and gathered user feedback to validate our approach. Each objective directly addresses one of the problems we identified earlier."

Reference: https://www.freecodecamp.org
```

### Script (1 minute):
"Let's examine FreeCodeCamp in detail, as it most closely aligns with our project-based philosophy. Its strengths are significant - it's completely free, has millions of active users, and focuses heavily on hands-on coding challenges. The open-source community is incredibly supportive.

However, we identified critical limitations. There's no direct instructor guidance, which means when students get stuck on complex problems, they're largely on their own. Beginners often struggle with the logic-based challenges. There's also minimal gamification - just basic progress tracking, not the competitive elements that drive engagement. These gaps informed our design decisions."

## Slide 10: Research Gap / Project Scope

### Content:
```
Research Gap & Innovation

What Existing Solutions Fail to Achieve:

1. No platform successfully combines project-based learning with 
   structured instructor guidance

2. Gamification elements are either absent or poorly implemented 
   (no meaningful rewards or competition)

3. Anti-cheat systems are basic or non-existent, undermining 
   assessment credibility

4. Most platforms use legacy technology stacks (PHP, Java), 
   resulting in poor performance

Our Innovation:

Unlike existing platforms, Build to Learn adds:
✓ Mandatory project completion before module progression
✓ Comprehensive gamification (points, leaderboards, achievements)
✓ Behavioral anti-cheat detection (tab switching, copy-paste prevention)
✓ Modern tech stack (Next.js 16, MongoDB) for superior performance
✓ One-active-course rule to maintain learning focus
```

### Script (1.5 minutes):
"Our research revealed four critical gaps. First, no platform successfully combines project-based learning with structured guidance. Students either get projects without support or support without projects.

Second, gamification is either missing or poorly done. Platforms that have it treat it as an afterthought, not a core engagement mechanism.

Third, anti-cheat systems are basic at best. Most platforms have no protection against tab switching or copy-pasting during quizzes.

Fourth, many LMS platforms use legacy technology - PHP, Java, outdated frameworks - making them slow and hard to maintain.

Our innovation directly addresses these gaps. We enforce mandatory project completion - you can't skip to the next module without building. We have comprehensive gamification with points, leaderboards, and achievements. We implement behavioral anti-cheat detection. We use a modern tech stack - Next.js 16 and MongoDB - for superior performance. And we enforce a one-active-course rule to keep students focused. This combination is our unique contribution to the field."

### Script (2 minutes):
"We followed an Agile methodology with 2-week sprints, allowing rapid iteration and adaptation. The project spanned 16 weeks across five phases.

Phase 1 was planning and design. We gathered requirements from our own learning experiences and those of fellow students. We designed the database schema, created UI wireframes, and selected our technology stack.

Phases 2 and 3 ran in parallel - backend and frontend development. For the backend, we implemented MongoDB schemas, built RESTful APIs with Express.js, integrated JWT authentication, and added Arcjet for security. On the frontend, we set up Next.js 16 with the App Router, created a component library using ShadCN UI, implemented state management with Zustand and TanStack Query, and designed responsive interfaces with Tailwind CSS v4.

Phase 4 focused on feature implementation - course management, the learning interface with video player, quiz system with anti-cheat, gamification with leaderboards, and certificate generation.

Finally, Phase 5 was testing and deployment. We conducted unit testing with Jest, performance testing with Lighthouse, security validation with Arcjet, and deployed the frontend to Vercel and backend to Coolify. This structured approach ensured we met all objectives within our timeline."

```

### Script (1.5 minutes):
"This use-case diagram illustrates the primary interactions for each user role. Students can register, browse courses, enroll, watch lessons, take quizzes, submit projects, view their progress, earn points, claim certificates, and build their CV. The system is designed around the student learning journey.

Instructors have different capabilities - they can create courses, manage modules, add various lesson types including videos, text, quizzes, and projects. They can also view analytics and track student progress.

Admins oversee the entire system - managing users, viewing system statistics, moderating content, and managing user roles. Notice the clear separation of concerns - each role has distinct permissions, enforced through role-based access control in our backend. This ensures security and prevents unauthorized access."

## Slide 13: Data Flow Diagram

### Content:
```
[Include Level 0, Level 1, and Level 2 DFD Images from Report]

Level 0 (Context Diagram):
• Shows system as single process
• External entities: Student, Instructor, Admin
• Data flows: Requests and Responses

Level 1 (Major Processes):
• Authentication Module
• Course Management Module
• Learning Module
• Assessment Module
• Certificate Module

Level 2 (Detailed Course Module):
• Video lesson data flow
• Quiz submission flow
• Project evaluation flow
• Progress tracking flow
```

### Script (1.5 minutes):
"Our data flow diagrams show how information moves through the system at three levels of detail. The Level 0 context diagram shows the system as a single process interacting with three external entities - students, instructors, and admins.

Level 1 breaks down the system into five major processes: Authentication handles user login and registration. Course Management deals with course creation and organization. The Learning Module manages lesson delivery. Assessment handles quizzes and projects. And Certificate Generation creates credentials upon course completion.

Level 2 provides detailed views of specific modules. For example, in the Course Module, we can see exactly how video lesson data flows, how quiz submissions are processed, how projects are evaluated, and how progress is tracked. Each process is stateless, allowing for horizontal scaling. Data flows are unidirectional, simplifying debugging and maintenance."

## Slide 14: Sequence Diagram

### Content:
```
[Include Key Sequence Diagrams from Report]

Key Workflows Illustrated:

1. User Registration:
   User → Frontend → Backend → Database
   • Input validation
   • Password hashing (bcrypt)
   • JWT token generation
   • Profile creation

2. Course Enrollment:
   Student → Check active courses → Create enrollment
   • Validates one-active-course rule
   • Initializes progress to 0%

3. Lesson Completion:
   Student → Complete lesson → Update progress → Award points
   • Verifies completion criteria
   • Updates database
   • Triggers gamification

4. Quiz Submission:
   Student → Submit answers → Auto-grade → Store results
   • Anti-cheat validation
   • Score calculation
   • Cheating flag storage
```

### Script (2 minutes):
"These sequence diagrams show step-by-step interactions for critical workflows. Let's walk through the user registration process: The user submits their details through the frontend. The backend validates the input, hashes the password using bcrypt for security, generates a JWT token, and creates both a user record and profile in the database. The entire process takes less than 200 milliseconds.

For course enrollment, the system first checks if the student has any active enrollments - remember our one-active-course rule. If not, it creates a new enrollment record and initializes progress to 0%.

Lesson completion is event-driven. When a student finishes a lesson, the frontend sends a completion request. The backend verifies the completion criteria - for videos, it checks watch time. It then updates the database and triggers the gamification system to award points.

Quiz submission includes anti-cheat validation. The system checks for suspicious behavior flags, calculates the score, and stores both the results and any cheating indicators. This ensures academic integrity while providing immediate feedback to students."

## Slide 15: System Design

### Content:
```
[Include System Architecture Diagram from Report]

3-Tier Architecture:

Presentation Layer (Client):
• Next.js 16 with App Router
• Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
• ShadCN UI components
• Zustand for state management
• TanStack Query for server state

Application Layer (Server):
• Node.js + Express.js
• JWT authentication
• Arcjet security middleware
• RESTful API endpoints

Data Layer:
• MongoDB (NoSQL database)
• 10 collections, 22 normalized tables
• Indexed queries (<50ms)
• Cloudinary for media storage

Communication:
• HTTPS with JSON payloads
• Axios for HTTP requests
• Cookie + Authorization header (hybrid auth)
```

### Script (2 minutes):
"Our system follows a 3-tier architecture with clear separation of concerns. At the presentation layer, we use Next.js 16 with the App Router for superior performance and SEO. Tailwind CSS v4 handles styling with a utility-first approach. ShadCN UI provides accessible, customizable components. Zustand manages client state with minimal overhead, while TanStack Query handles server state caching and synchronization.

The application layer is built on Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust RESTful API. We use JWT for authentication and Arcjet for enterprise-grade security - bot detection, rate limiting, and attack protection.

The data layer uses MongoDB, with 10 collections that normalize to 22 SQL-equivalent tables. We leverage indexed queries to achieve sub-50-millisecond response times. Media files are stored on Cloudinary rather than our database, reducing server load and enabling faster content delivery.

Communication between layers uses HTTPS with JSON payloads. We implement a hybrid authentication strategy - cookies for web browsers and Authorization headers for API clients - ensuring maximum compatibility. This architecture is scalable, maintainable, and secure."

## Slide 16: Database Design

### Content:
```
[Include ER Diagram and Schema Diagram from Report]

Database Structure:

Core Collections (10 total):
1. Users (5 tables): Authentication, profile, skills, experience, education
2. Courses (4 tables): Catalog, enrollments, modules, lessons
3. Quiz System (6 tables): Questions, options, results, answers, cheating flags
4. Enrollments (2 tables): Tracking, completed modules
5. Certificates (1 table): Achievements
6. Community (4 tables): Posts, tags, likes, comments

Key Relationships:
• Users ←→ Enrollments ←→ Courses (Many-to-Many)
• Courses → Modules → Lessons (One-to-Many)
• Lessons → Questions → Options (One-to-Many)

Business Rules Enforced:
• One active enrollment per student
• Sequential module unlocking
• Immutable certificate data
```

### Script (2 minutes):
"Our database design supports all core functionalities while maintaining data integrity. We have 10 MongoDB collections that normalize to 22 SQL-equivalent tables.

The Users collection includes authentication data, profile information, skills, work experience, and education for the CV builder. The Courses collection manages the catalog, enrollments, modules, and lessons. The Quiz System is comprehensive - questions, options, results, individual answers, and cheating flags for our anti-cheat system.

Key relationships include a many-to-many relationship between Users and Courses through the Enrollments intermediary. Courses contain Modules, which contain Lessons in a hierarchical one-to-many structure. Lessons can have Questions, which have Options.

We enforce three critical business rules at the database level. First, one active enrollment per student - this is validated before creating new enrollments. Second, sequential module unlocking - modules are locked until the previous one is completed. Third, immutable certificate data - we snapshot course titles, student names, and instructor names at generation time, so certificates remain accurate even if data changes later.

This structure prevents data duplication, ensures consistency, and supports efficient queries through proper indexing."

Authentication → Course Management → Learning Interface → 
Quiz System → Gamification → Testing
```

### Script (1.5 minutes):
"This Gantt chart visualizes our 16-week development timeline. Weeks 1-2 were dedicated to planning and database design - a critical foundation. Weeks 3-4 focused on authentication, which was essential for all subsequent features.

Course management backend development occurred in weeks 5-6, while frontend setup and component creation happened in weeks 7-8. Notice the overlapping tasks - we parallelized frontend and backend work from weeks 5-10 to maximize efficiency.

The learning interface was implemented in weeks 9-10, followed by the quiz system and anti-cheat in weeks 11-12. Gamification and certificate generation were completed in week 13, and the CV builder in week 14.

Testing spanned weeks 13-16, overlapping with final feature development. This allowed us to catch and fix bugs early. Deployment preparation occurred in the final two weeks.

The critical path - Authentication, Course Management, Learning Interface, Quiz System, Gamification, and Testing - ensured dependencies were respected. By parallelizing independent tasks and maintaining a clear critical path, we met our deadline successfully."

```

### Script (1.5 minutes):
"As an academic project developed for CSE 400, we successfully operated with a zero-cost budget. We maximized the use of free-tier services available to developers and students.

Our development time of nearly 2,000 hours was a volunteer contribution. For infrastructure, we used the free tiers of MongoDB Atlas for the database, Vercel for frontend hosting, and self-hosted the backend during development. We utilized the GitHub Student Developer Pack to obtain our domain name and other tools for free. Media storage is handled by Cloudinary's free tier, and security by Arcjet's free plan.

This demonstrates a key strength of modern web development: enterprise-grade applications can be built and prototyped without significant capital investment, making it accessible for student innovation. However, we have also calculated that a production-scale deployment would cost approximately 26,000 Taka per month for premium services."

## Slide 21: Testing

### Content:
```
Testing Strategy

Multi-Layered Approach:

1. Unit Testing (Jest):
   • Backend logic testing (point calculation, enrollment validation)
   • 16 tests implemented
   • 80% code coverage achieved

2. Static Analysis (Biome):
   • Client-side linting and formatting
   • Catches syntax errors before build
   • Enforces code conventions

3. Integration Testing:
   • Data flow between client and server
   • Critical paths (quiz completion → module unlock)
   • Database consistency validation

4. Performance Testing (Lighthouse):
   • Mobile: 90/100 score
   • Desktop: 100/100 score
   • Time to Interactive reduced by 40%

5. Security Testing (Arcjet):
   • Rate limiting validation
   • Bot attack simulation
   • NoSQL injection prevention

6. Usability Testing:
   • Think-aloud sessions with CSE students
   • Task completion analysis
   • Interface feedback collection

Tools Used:
• Jest + Supertest (unit/integration)
• Biome (static analysis)
• Lighthouse (performance)
• Postman (API testing)
• MongoDB Atlas (query monitoring)
```

### Script (2 minutes):
"We implemented a comprehensive multi-layered testing strategy. Unit testing with Jest covered backend logic - point calculations, enrollment validation, certificate generation. We implemented 16 tests and achieved 80% code coverage.

Static analysis with Biome caught syntax errors and enforced code conventions on the client side before code even reached the build stage.

Integration testing focused on data flow between client and server, particularly critical paths like quiz completion triggering module unlock, ensuring database consistency.

Performance testing with Google Lighthouse was particularly successful. We achieved a 90 out of 100 score for mobile devices and a perfect 100 out of 100 for desktop. We reduced Time to Interactive by 40% through Next.js optimizations like code splitting and lazy loading.

Security testing with Arcjet validated our rate limiting, simulated bot attacks, and verified NoSQL injection prevention through Mongoose sanitization.

Usability testing involved think-aloud sessions with fellow CSE students. We asked them to complete specific tasks like 'Find a Python course' while voicing their thoughts. Initial feedback indicated the dashboard was slightly overwhelming, so we planned a 'Getting Started' tour as an upcoming feature.

This comprehensive testing ensured our platform is functional, performant, secure, and user-friendly."

## Slide 25: Limitations

### Content:
```
Current Limitations

Technical Limitations:
• Concurrent Users: Tested up to 50 (scalable with load balancer)
• Video Hosting: Relies on external URLs (YouTube, Vimeo)
• File Storage: Limited by Cloudinary free tier (25GB)
• Testing: 80% coverage (target: 100%)
• Mobile App: Web-only (no native iOS/Android)

Functional Limitations:
• One Active Course: Students can't multi-task courses
• Anti-Cheat: Client-side only (can be bypassed by advanced users)
• Grading: Auto-grading for MCQ only (no essay grading)
• Communication: No real-time chat (async forum only)
• Payment: No integrated payment system (free courses only)

Security Limitations:
• Anti-Cheat: Can't detect second monitor or phone usage
• Proctoring: No webcam monitoring
• DDoS: Limited protection on free tier

Acknowledgment:
These limitations are acknowledged and addressable. Most can be 
resolved with:
• Upgraded service tiers (MongoDB Atlas M10, Cloudinary Pro)
• Additional features (WebRTC for chat, Stripe for payments)
• Infrastructure improvements (Redis caching, load balancer)
• Advanced proctoring (webcam integration)
```

### Script (2 minutes):
"Let's be transparent about our limitations. Technically, we've tested up to 50 concurrent users, though the system is scalable with a load balancer. We rely on external video hosting like YouTube and Vimeo rather than self-hosting. We're limited by Cloudinary's free tier of 25GB. Our test coverage is 80%, not the ideal 100%. And we don't have a native mobile app, though the web app is mobile-responsive.

Functionally, the one-active-course rule may frustrate advanced learners who want to multi-task. Our anti-cheat is client-side only and can be bypassed by determined users. We only auto-grade MCQs, not essays. There's no real-time chat - only an asynchronous forum. And there's no payment integration, so all courses must be free.

Security-wise, we can't detect second monitors or phone cameras. We lack webcam proctoring. And DDoS protection is limited on the free tier.

However, these limitations are acknowledged and addressable. Most can be resolved by upgrading to paid service tiers - MongoDB Atlas M10, Cloudinary Pro. We can add features like WebRTC for real-time chat and Stripe for payments. Infrastructure improvements like Redis caching and load balancers would increase capacity. And advanced proctoring with webcam integration is technically feasible.

The key point is that these aren't fundamental design flaws - they're conscious trade-offs we made for an academic project with limited resources and timeline."

## Common Defense Questions & Suggested Answers

### Q: Why didn't you use TypeScript?
**A**: "Excellent question. We chose JavaScript for three reasons: faster initial development for our 16-week timeline, lower learning curve for all three team members to contribute equally, and sufficient type safety through JSDoc comments and ESLint. However, we acknowledge TypeScript would provide better type safety and IDE support. If we were to start over or continue development, migrating to TypeScript would be a priority."

### Q: How did you divide work among three team members?
**A**: "We divided responsibilities based on individual strengths while ensuring everyone gained full-stack experience. Maruf focused on backend architecture and database design, Nishat led frontend development and UI/UX design, and Sohel handled testing and deployment. However, we practiced pair programming for complex features and conducted code reviews for all pull requests, ensuring everyone understood the entire codebase."

### Q: What happens if Arcjet goes down?
**A**: "Great question about resilience. Currently, Arcjet is integrated as middleware, so if it's unavailable, requests would fail. To handle this in production, we would implement a circuit breaker pattern: if Arcjet doesn't respond within 500 milliseconds, we bypass it temporarily and log the event. This ensures availability while maintaining security when possible. It's a trade-off between security and uptime that we'd configure based on deployment requirements."

### Q: How do you prevent students from sharing quiz answers?
**A**: "We implement multiple safeguards. First, quiz questions can be shuffled, so students see different orders. Second, we track and flag suspicious behavior like tab switching. Third, instructors can create question banks and randomize which questions appear. Fourth, we log timestamps and IP addresses. However, we acknowledge that determined students can still share answers. The real solution is making quizzes just one part of assessment - the mandatory project work is much harder to cheat on because each student must demonstrate their code works."

### Q: Can you explain the one-active-course rule? Isn't it limiting?
**A**: "The one-active-course rule was a deliberate design decision based on our own experience. We found that students who enroll in multiple courses simultaneously often complete none - they get overwhelmed and abandon everything. By enforcing focus on one course at a time, we increase completion rates. However, we acknowledge this may frustrate advanced learners. In future versions, we could make this configurable - perhaps allowing instructors or admins to grant exceptions for high-performing students."

### Q: How do you ensure certificate authenticity?
**A**: "Each certificate has a unique UUID stored in our database. Anyone can verify a certificate by visiting our public endpoint `/api/certificates/:certificateId`, which returns the certificate details if valid. We also snapshot immutable data - course title, student name, instructor name - at generation time, so certificates remain accurate even if data changes later. For enhanced security in the future, we're considering blockchain-based certificates as NFTs, which would provide cryptographic proof of authenticity."

### Q: What's your disaster recovery plan?
**A**: "For production deployment, we would implement several layers of protection. First, daily automated backups to MongoDB Atlas with point-in-time recovery enabled. Second, replica sets for high availability - if one database node fails, others continue serving requests. Third, our Docker containerization means we can redeploy the entire application on new infrastructure within minutes. Fourth, we'd use a CDN for static assets so they're distributed globally. In case of catastrophic failure, we could restore from the most recent backup within 15 minutes."

### Q: How did you test the anti-cheat system?
**A**: "We tested anti-cheat through both automated and manual methods. Automated tests simulated tab switching, paste events, and focus loss, verifying that flags were correctly logged. Manual testing involved team members attempting to cheat during quiz sessions while we monitored the backend logs. We confirmed that flags were stored with accurate timestamps and details. We also tested the threshold system - only flagging attempts with more than 5 suspicious events to avoid false positives. However, we acknowledge this is client-side detection and can be bypassed by advanced users. Future enhancements would include server-side proctoring."
