## **Option 2: Detailed Gantt Chart (Example for first 3 months)**

_(This would be a more granular chart, perhaps using weeks or bi-weekly periods. Too long to fully write out here, but here's the idea)_

### **Phase 1: Planning & Design (Apr - May 2025)**

- **Week 1-2 (Apr):** Finalize Project Scope, SRS Outline, Tech Stack Choice
- **Week 3-4 (Apr):** Detailed SRS v1.0, Initial Database Design
- **Week 5-6 (May):** UI/UX Wireframes for Key Flows, Refine DB Design
- **Week 7-8 (May):** Setup Git, Dev Env, Basic Next.js Project, Task Board (Trello/Jira)

### **Phase 2: Core Dev - User Auth & Roles (May - Jun 2025)**

- **Week 8-9 (May):** User Registration & Login Backend (Next.js API)
- **Week 10-11 (Jun):** User Registration & Login Frontend
- **Week 12-13 (Jun):** Role Management (Student, Instructor, Admin, Mod - DB & API)
- **Week 14 (Jun):** User Profile Page (View/Edit)

_Continue this pattern to break down each monthly feature into 2–4 week development blocks._
