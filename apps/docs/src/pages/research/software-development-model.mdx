# Software Development Model for "Build to Learn" Project

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Build to Learn
**Duration:** April 2025 ‚Äì December 2025 (9 months)
**Phases:** Split into three quarters:

* **Q2:** April ‚Äì June
* **Q3:** July ‚Äì September
* **Q4:** October ‚Äì December

## Recommended Software Development Model

### üìÖ **Incremental and Iterative Development Model (Hybrid Agile-Incremental)**

This model combines the best of both Incremental and Agile approaches to support modular development, evolving features, and continuous feedback throughout the development cycle.

## ‚úÖ Why This Model is Ideal

| Feature                 | Project Fit                | Model Advantage                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Defined Timeline**    | Fixed 9-month window       | Deliver working software in stages                |
| **Multiple Modules**    | Blog, Forum, Dashboard, AI | Each developed as separate increments             |
| **Evolving Complexity** | Later AI & API integration | Defer risky components while delivering core      |
| **Team-Based**          | Parallel contributions     | Supports distributed modular work                 |
| **Testing and Docs**    | Unit tests, documentation  | Early delivery allows time for testing & feedback |

## üîß Model Structure & Timeline

### **Q2 (April ‚Äì June)**

**Increment 1:** Project Foundation

* Planning & Research (April - May)
* Architecture & Setup (May - June)
* Choose tech stack, workflows, and repositories
* Setup monorepo with Turborepo, CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Docker)

### **Q3 (July ‚Äì September)**

**Increment 2:** Application Development

* Blog and Forum Web App Design (June - July)
* Web and Dashboard Design (July - August)
* Backend API + Business Logic Implementation (August - September)
* Documentation writing and Unit Test Phase 1 (August - September)

### **Q4 (October ‚Äì December)**

**Increment 3:** Integration & Deployment

* AI Integration + Frontend-Backend Connection (September - November)
* Final Testing & Bug Fixes (December)
* Final Deployment to production (December)

---

## üåê Agile Enhancements

To increase collaboration and flexibility within increments:

* ‚úÖ 2-week sprints for each sub-task/module
* ‚úÖ Daily or bi-weekly team standups
* ‚úÖ Task tracking via Trello, Notion, or GitHub Projects
* ‚úÖ Monthly retrospectives for continuous improvement
* ‚úÖ Regular code reviews and pair programming for knowledge sharing

---

## üìù Example Increment Breakdown

### **Increment 1:** Planning & Setup

* Define features, scope, and timeline
* Research learning platforms (case studies: freeCodeCamp, edX)
* Setup backend environment, linting, and CI workflows

### **Increment 2:** Feature Implementation

* Blog & Forum MVPs
* Auth & user roles (student, instructor, admin)
* RESTful APIs with security & validation

### **Increment 3:** Advanced Features & Delivery

* AI suggestions/feedback integration
* Frontend connection with backend via API
* UI/UX finalization, testing, and optimization

---

## üöÄ Benefits of This Model

* **Early delivery**: Tangible outputs every quarter
* **Risk mitigation**: Defer complex components (e.g., AI) to later phases
* **User feedback**: Allows iterative refinement
* **Parallel work**: Supports teamwork and CI/CD integration

---

## üéØ Summary

The **Hybrid Agile-Incremental Model** is best suited for the "Build to Learn" project due to its modularity, adaptability, and timeline compatibility. This model ensures steady progress, collaborative development, and high-quality delivery within the project timeframe.
