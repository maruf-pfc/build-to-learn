## Introduction

Measuring lines of code (LOC) is a valuable practice for assessing project complexity, tracking development progress, and optimizing code efficiency. In this article, we'll explore the most efficient ways to count LOC across **any software project**, covering:

- Built-in command-line methods
- Third-party tools
- Pros and cons of each approach
- Hands-on demonstrations
- A comparison of `tokei` and `cloc` to determine the best choice

## Methods to Count LOC

### 1. `tokei` (Recommended)

[`tokei`](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei) is a high-performance, Rust-based tool designed for speed and accuracy in LOC analysis.

#### **Installation**

```bash
cargo install tokei
```

#### **Usage**

```bash
tokei
```

#### **Example Output**

```bash
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Language          files    blank    comment    code
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JavaScript        12       320      90         1250
TypeScript        8        190      60         920
CSS               4        110      25         450
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total             24       620      175        2620
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### If cargo and rust are not installed, you can use the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

```bash
cargo install tokei
```

### alternatively, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install rustc cargo
```

#### **Pros & Cons**

✅ Exceptional speed and performance

✅ Provides a detailed breakdown by language

✅ Supports multiple programming languages

❌ Requires Rust & Cargo installation

### 2. `cloc`

[`cloc`](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc) (Count Lines of Code) is a widely used tool that accurately counts lines while ignoring empty lines and comments.

#### **Installation**

```bash
npm install -g cloc
```

#### **Usage**

```bash
cloc --include-ext=js,jsx,ts,tsx,css,scss,html .
```

#### **Example Output**

```bash
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Language          files    blank    comment    code
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JavaScript        12       300      100        1200
TypeScript        8        200      50         900
CSS               4        100      30         400
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total             24       600      180        2500
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### **Pros & Cons**

✅ Simple installation and usage

✅ Ignores blank lines and comments for accuracy

✅ Works across multiple platforms

c Slower than `tokei`

### 3. `wc -l` (Basic CLI Method)

The `wc -l` command provides a quick count of lines but lacks filtering capabilities.

#### **Usage**

```bash
find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.jsx" | xargs wc -l
```

#### **Example Output**

```bash
2300 total
```

#### **Pros & Cons**

✅ No additional installations required

✅ Works on Linux and macOS

❌ Counts blank lines and comments

❌ Not available on Windows by default

### 4. `git ls-files` (For Git Projects)

This method counts lines only in files tracked by Git, making it useful for repositories.

#### **Usage**

```bash
git ls-files '*.js' '*.jsx' '*.ts' '*.tsx' | xargs wc -l
```

#### **Example Output**

```bash
1800 total
```

#### **Pros & Cons**

✅ Works efficiently within Git repositories

✅ Filters out ignored and unnecessary files

❌ Ignores untracked files

## **Choosing Between `tokei` and `cloc`**

| Feature                 | `tokei`       | `cloc`   |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Speed                   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐    | ⭐⭐⭐   |
| Accuracy                | ⭐⭐⭐        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Detailed Breakdown      | ✅            | ✅       |
| Ignores Comments        | ✅            | ✅       |
| Windows Support         | ✅            | ✅       |
| Installation Complexity | Requires Rust | Easy     |

### **When to Use `tokei`**

- You need the fastest LOC counting tool
- Your project is large and performance is a priority
- You want support for multiple languages

### **When to Use `cloc`**

- You prefer an easy-to-install solution
- You need an accurate count while ignoring empty lines
- You work on smaller projects where speed is less critical

For professional development workflows, **`tokei` is the superior choice** due to its unparalleled speed and detailed output. However, `cloc` remains a strong alternative for those who prioritize ease of installation over performance.

## **Conclusion**

| Method         | Speed      | Accuracy | Works on Windows? | Requires Install? |
| -------------- | ---------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `tokei`        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐   | ✅                | ✅                |
| `cloc`         | ⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ✅                | ✅                |
| `wc -l`        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐     | ❌                | ❌                |
| `git ls-files` | ⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐   | ✅                | ❌                |

For most developers, **`tokei` is the best choice** due to its high-speed performance and detailed reporting. If you require a simpler setup, `cloc` remains a viable alternative.

Measure your project's complexity with **`tokei`** today and enhance your development workflow!
